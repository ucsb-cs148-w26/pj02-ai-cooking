AI Cooking App

Description

Our ideal users are people who don't know how to cook or need help thinking of ideas for what to cook.

An AI cooking app would only have one kind of user: those seeking assistance with cooking.

Users will be able to upload what ingredients they have and when they bought them, as well as what cuisine they want to make or if they have any allergies/restrictions. They will recieve recipes based on their ingredients and updates about when ingredients are about to expire.

They goals could be to eat healthier and learn how to cook and our app helps them accomplish this by giving them recipies tailored to their individual preferences and ingredients.
