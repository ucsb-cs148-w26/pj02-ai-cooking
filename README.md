Audience
Who are your ideal users?

How many different kinds of users are there, and what are their roles?

Examples:

A ride-share app MVP has two kinds of users: those looking for rides and those offering rides.
A third kind of user role you might need is site admins, users who can have the power to delete anyone’s posting.
A game app might have only one kind of user: a game player
A Recipe sharer app might have two kinds:
Users who look up recipes, but can’t add new data to the system
Admins who can upload new data to the system
Later, you might also allow user-contributed content; in that case, you might want admins to have the ability to delete inappropriate content.

What will each different kind of user be able to do in your app?

What are their goals in using their app?
How does your app allow them to accomplish their goal?
