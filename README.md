<h1 style="color:green">AI Cooking App</h1>

**Description:**

This app helps people who do not know how to cook, feel stuck on what to make, or want to eat healthier using the ingredients they already have. It does this by keeping track of the user's inventory of food and provides recipies that will prioritize food about to go bad in order to finish them before decaying.

**Tech Stack:**

- We chose Next.js for its seamless combination of React, server-side rendering, and API routes, allowing us to build a fast, scalable full-stack application with minimal overhead.

- We chose Vercel for its native support of Next.js, zero-config deployments, and automatic scaling, which lets us iterate quickly without managing infrastructure.

- We chose Firebase for its authentication, real-time database, and serverless backend services, enabling rapid development while maintaining security and reliability.

**User Roles:**

- The primary user is someone seeking personalized cooking support. They may be a beginner, busy student, or anyone trying to reduce food waste and build confidence in the kitchen. 

- There are two kinds of users: one is the people directly uses that app for suggestion on cooking and reduce food waste, and the other is businesses or developers using the app's data, AI, or features to build their own products or services.

- Users will be able to upload what ingredients they have, when they bought them, preferences they have like cuisine type, and if they have any allergies/restrictions. The app will then recommend recipes that match what they already own, prioritize ingredients that are closest to expiring, and send reminders when items are about to go bad.

- Their goals could be to learn how to cook and reduce food waste and our app supports this by generating recipes tailored to the user’s exact pantry, preferences, and skill level, plus step by step guidance while they cook.

- Our app provides mainly two features, AI recipe suggestions and prioritization based on item freshness, to allow them to accomplish their goal.

**Permissions:**

- Anyone can use our app with a valid email address.
