#User Journey

Many people do not know how to cook, feel stuck on what to make, or want to eat healthier using the ingredients they already have. Our product can help users meet these goals by keeping track of the user's inventory of food and providing recipes that will prioritize food about to go bad in order to finish them before decaying.

As someone who wastes a lot of food, I can receive recipes that use items in my kitchen that are about to expire so that I can reduce food waste.

As a pescatarian, I can enter in my no meat restriction and fish preference into the web app so that I can receive tailored recipes that can be made with the ingredients in my kitchen.

As a student who is learning how to cook. One often buys too much groceries that they don’t know what to do with. The app will help me keep track of expiration dates of my food, along with mixing and matching them to create tailored recipes. 

As a busy worker, I need to buy everything once a week or two weeks. So I am afraid of the food going bad. The app reminds me about the expiration date and the suggested recipes for best taste.

As a home cooking enthusiast with limited time, I want to organize my recipes, track my ingredient inventory, and get reminded before food expires, so that I can cook spontaneously without waste and always know what meals I can prepare.
