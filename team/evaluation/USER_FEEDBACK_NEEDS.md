# PantryPal User Feedback

## User Feedback Goals

We would like user feedback on:

- User satisfaction with the overall product (first-time and ongoing use)
- How helpful the generated recipes actually are
- How accurate the image scanner is
- Whether the combination of:
  - Landing
  - Signup/Onboarding
  - Dashboard (Scan, Pantry, Recipes, Calendar)
  
  feels clear and easy to navigate.

## Metrics to Measure Improvement

1) Out of the 3 recipes that were generated, what percent of testers would use at least 1 recipe that was generated?
2) For each tester, how many out of the 3 recipes would you use 1,2, or 3?
3) For each reciept/fridge image inserted, how many items were correctly identified?
4) On average how long did image detection take?
