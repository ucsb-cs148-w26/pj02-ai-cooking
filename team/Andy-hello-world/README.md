This is the Lab01 "Hello World" read me for Andy Wang

I chose React Native with Expo because our team works across Windows and macOS. Expo allows every team member to develop and test the iOS version of the app directly on their own physical devices, regardless of their computer's operating system.

To run this project, you need:
   Node.js installed on your computer
   Expo Go app installed on your phone (available on App Store and Google Play).

How to run the app

first cd in to the project directory and open a terminal. Then run this on the terminal to install dependency.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

After you installed the dependency you can start the development sever by typing this command in the same terminal
    ```bash
    npx expo start
    ```

Then you should be able to scan the QR code on expo app on your phone to open the hello world file.

OR

You can press W to open web

Yay, how you have opened the app made by me
