# Retrospective 18, Feb 2026

* Led by: Yuxi Ji
* Present: Yuxi Ji, Daniel Du, Krisha Soneji, Mahima Chaudhary, Andy Wang
* Absent: none

## Action Item

* **A goal:** Improve how we work together on overlapping files and reduce merge conflicts, while making the app feel more like a food app based on user feedback.

* **A change:** We will establish a clearer merge and branching strategy before the next sprint (e.g., smaller feature branches, more frequent syncs with main, and clearer ownership of files). We will also document the deployment setup (Vercel env vars, Firebase config) so other team members can troubleshoot if needed.

* **A measurement:** 
  - Fewer merge conflicts in the next sprint compared to sprint 01.
  - At least one piece of user feedback that the app “feels more food-related” after our UI changes.

## Optional

* Sprint 01 MVP delivered all core features (manual entry, login/signup, AI scanning, recipe generation, expiration progress bar, account page). The main pain points were deployment setup and merge conflicts.
* User feedback was mostly positive on UI clarity and onboarding, but concerns about gradients, readability, recipe flow length, and onboarding length will guide our next sprint.
* Communities / recipe sharing is a stretch goal for the next sprint if time permits.
