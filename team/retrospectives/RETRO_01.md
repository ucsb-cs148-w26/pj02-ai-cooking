SPRINT RETRO
# Date of Retrospective: 01/23/25

* Led by: Daniel 
* Present: Krisha, Mahima, Yuxi, Andy
* Absent: n/a

## Action item

* A goal: The team wants to get better at working together on tasks and asking each other for help
* a change/experiment: The team will have more meetings outside of class to work on individual tasks together, and will be able to have other team members accessible if they need help
* a measurement: We will see if tasks get completed more quickly on the Kanban board, as having more meetings should enable the tasks to be completed quicker since we are all able to share knowledge and experience.

## Retro Assessment

* We used the Start/Stop/Continue method
* It was very quick and allowed team members to effectively share their inputs. I think it went well and was very insightful to know how other members were feeling
* I would tell the next person leading the retro to ensure that every person gets their chance to speak and to make sure to ask every person for their inputs

## Experiment/Change

* TBA
