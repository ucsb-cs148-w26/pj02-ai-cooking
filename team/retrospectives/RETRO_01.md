SPRINT RETRO
# Date of Retrospective: 01/23/26

* Led by: Daniel 
* Present: Krisha, Mahima, Yuxi, Andy
* Absent: N/A

## Action item

* Goal: The team wants to improve collaboration on tasks and feel more comfortable asking each other for help when needed.
* Change / Experiment: The team will have more meetings outside of class to work on individual tasks together, and will be able to have other team members accessible if they need help
* Measurement: We will see if tasks get completed more quickly on the Kanban board, as having more meetings should enable the tasks to be completed quicker since we are all able to share knowledge and experience.

## Retro Assessment

* Process used: We used the Start/Stop/Continue retrospective method.
* How it went: It was very quick and allowed team members to effectively share their inputs. I think it went well and was very insightful to know how other members were feeling
* Advice for next retro leader: I would tell the next person leading the retro to ensure that every person gets their chance to speak and to make sure to ask every person for their inputs

## Experiment/Change

* Description: The team experimented with holding additional out-of-class meetings focused on collaborative work rather than status updates, allowing members to ask for help in real time.
* Assessment: After starting this change, the team noticed that questions were resolved more quickly and members felt more comfortable reaching out for help instead of working in isolation.
* Decision going forward: We will continue holding these collaborative meetings in future sprints and adjust the frequency if needed based on workload.
