Scribed Discussion:

We spent time with our larger group deciding how to split the team, which delayed our sprint meeting so Prof Kate has given us until Friday to complete today's work

Andy is unable to come to class so he joined via Discord

Daniel and Yuxi were having merge conflicts with their .md files that they are currently working on. 

Everyone is working on lab1 still to get ready for the Friday submission
