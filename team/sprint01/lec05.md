Scribed Discussion:

We discussed a plan of updating our files for the App to make sure that it is easy to deploy both locally and on Vercel (in the future).

We updated the Kanban Board and will make sure the future PRs use feature branches which use names matching the tasks on the Kanban Board.

We all worked on the assigned tasks, and we will continue to work on these.
