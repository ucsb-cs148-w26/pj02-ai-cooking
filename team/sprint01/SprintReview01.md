## Sprint Goal

The primary objective of this sprint was to deliver an MVP with our main features. The features we included in this sprint were:

- Manual pantry entry
- Login / signup
- AI receipt and fridge scanning
- AI recipe generation
- Expiration progress bar and reminders
- Account page with login-state header

---

## Challenges & Blockers

- **Vercel / Firebase setup:** Deployment was limited because only one team member could connect their Vercel account to the GitHub repository for automatic deployments.
- **Learning curve:** Many team members had not used this tech stack (Next.js, Firebase, Vercel) before, so it took time to get familiar with the tools.
- **Merge conflicts:** We encountered occasional merge conflicts when multiple people worked on overlapping files.

## User Feedback

### Positive Feedback:

- Clean, colorful, vibrant UI,
- Login and onboarding pages look good,
- Simple and beginner-friendly interface,
- Clear categories and layout

### Concerns:

- Background gradients are distracting or cause lag
- Text readability could be improved
- UI feels like a form or social media app instead of food-related
- Too many steps or pages for recipe generation
- Onboarding may feel too long
- Manual data entry takes too much time

## Key Learnings
We learned how to work together as a team better and communicate more effectively. We also overcame a lot of technical obstacles that we weren’t used to. For example, a lot of our team members haven't used our tech stack before so it took some getting used to. We are more prepared to take on our next sprint!

## Next Sprint Focus

- **UI refinement:** Improve the visual design so it feels more like a food app, addressing feedback on gradients, readability, and overall tone.
- **Account page enhancements:** Continue improving the account page and user preferences experience.
- **Bug fixes:** Fix remaining issues such as pantry items not deleting in some cases and further improve expiration tracking.
- **Communities (stretch):** If time permits, add a feature where users can share recipes with each other and rate them.

## Action Items

1. Reduce the number of steps in recipe generation.
2. Improve text contrast and readability across the app.
3. Simplify or shorten the onboarding flow based on user feedback.
