Sprint Number: sprint01

Sprint Duration: 4 weeks

Team Members: Yuxi Ji, Daniel Du, Krisha Soneji, Mahima Chaudhary, Andy Wang

## Sprint Goal
The primary objective of this sprint was to deliver an MVP with our main features. The features we included in this sprint were manual pantry entry, login/signup, AI receipt/fridge scanning and AI recipe generation.

## Challenges & Blockers
We had technical issues with Vercel/Firebase since only one person can have an account. A lot of the team members also hadn’t used the tech stack before so it took some getting used to. We also had issues with occasional merge conflicts.

## User Feedback
- Positive Feedback:
    Clean, colorful, vibrant UI
    Login and onboarding pages look good
    Simple and beginner-friendly interface
    Clear categories and layout
- Concerns:
    Background gradients are distracting or cause lag
    Text readability could be improved
    UI feels like a form or social media app instead of food-related
    Too many steps or pages for recipe generation
    Onboarding may feel too long
    Manual data entry takes too much time

## Key Learnings
We learned how to work together as a team better and communicate more effectively. We also overcame a lot of technical obstacles that we weren’t used to. For example, a lot of our team members haven't used our tech stack before so it took some getting used to. We are more prepared to take on our next sprint!

## Next Sprint Focus
We plan on improving our UI and adding an account page so that it reads more like a food app than a social media app as stated in our feedback. We additionally hope to incorporate communities where users can share recipes with each other and rank them if we have time. Finally, we had some small bugs where pantry items wouldn’t delete or expiration dates would not work which we also plan on fixing.
