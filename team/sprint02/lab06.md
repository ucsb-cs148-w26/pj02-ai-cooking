For Lab 06 we ran **Retrospective 02** and submit it as our Lab 06 deliverable. The full retro is in **`team/retrospectives/RETRO_02.md`**. Summary below.

## Scribed Discussion (User Feedback)

We defined and documented our user feedback needs in **`team/evaluation/USER_FEEDBACK_NEEDS.md`**. We decided to focus on **overall product satisfaction** (first-time and ongoing use) for the full flow: **landing → signup/onboarding → dashboard (Scan, Pantry, Recipes, Calendar)**. We want to know whether this flow feels clear and valuable to users.

## Action Item

* **Goal:** Improve how we work together on overlapping files and reduce merge conflicts, and make the app feel more like a food app based on user feedback.
* **Change:** Clearer merge and branching strategy (smaller feature branches, more frequent syncs with main, clearer ownership of files). Document deployment setup (Vercel env vars, Firebase config) so others can troubleshoot.
* **Measurement:** Fewer merge conflicts than sprint 01; at least one piece of user feedback that the app "feels more food-related" after UI changes.

## Retro Process

We used **Start / Stop / Continue**. It was quick and let everyone share; main themes were merge conflicts and deployment setup. We left with a clear action item and measurement.

## Experiment / Change

We adopted: (1) Feature branch per task or sub-issue. (2) Sync with main at least once per day. (3) Deployment doc for Vercel and Firebase. Results: fewer merge conflicts, and at least one other member could run or troubleshoot deployment. We will keep this change.
