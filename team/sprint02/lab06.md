Scribed Discussion:

We defined and documented our user feedback needs in **`team/evaluation/USER_FEEDBACK_NEEDS.md`**. We decided to focus on **overall product satisfaction** (first-time and ongoing use) for the full flow: **landing → signup/onboarding → dashboard (Scan, Pantry, Recipes, Calendar)**. We want to know whether this flow feels clear and valuable to users.
