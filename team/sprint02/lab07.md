## Scribed Discussion

We worked together on **user feedback** this lab. Our goal was to agree on what we want to learn from users and how we will measure improvement.

We defined and documented our user feedback needs in **`team/evaluation/USER_FEEDBACK_NEEDS.md`**. We decided to focus on **overall product satisfaction** (first-time and ongoing use) for the full flow: **landing → signup/onboarding → dashboard (Scan, Pantry, Recipes, Calendar)**. We want to know whether this flow feels clear and valuable to users.

We agreed on a set of **specific questions** to ask users during feedback sessions and defined **metrics to measure improvement**

We aligned on using these questions and metrics so we can run user evaluations in future labs and use the results to guide design and feature work.
