## Scribed Discussion

e worked together on **user feedback** this lab. Our goal was to agree on what we want to learn from users and how we will measure improvement.

We defined and documented our user feedback needs in **`team/evaluation/USER_FEEDBACK_NEEDS.md`**. We decided to focus on **overall product satisfaction** (first-time and ongoing use) for the full flow: **landing → signup/onboarding → dashboard (Scan, Pantry, Recipes, Calendar)**. We want to know whether this flow feels clear and valuable to users.

We agreed on a set of **specific questions** to ask users during feedback sessions:

- Is there a way for us to make the UI better?
- Is the UI intuitive and cohesive?
- Were you ever confused about what to click next? If so, where?
- How many clicks did it take you to complete a core task (e.g., add an item, generate a recipe, check expiration reminders)?
- Are there any more features you would like to see in our app?
- How would you rate our product on a scale of 1–10 for: functionality, website design, and user experience?

We also defined **metrics to measure improvement**:

1. Achieve an average rating of at least **8/10** in functionality, website design, and user experience.
2. At least **80%** of testers report they can complete a core task (add item, generate recipe, view expiration reminder) **without asking for clarification**.

We aligned on using these questions and metrics so we can run user evaluations in future labs and use the results to guide design and feature work.
