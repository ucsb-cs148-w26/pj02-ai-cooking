## Scribed Discussion

We worked together on **user feedback** this lab. We defined and documented our user feedback needs in `team/evaluation/USER_FEEDBACK_NEEDS.md`. We focused on **overall product satisfaction** (first-time and ongoing use) for the full flow: landing → signup/onboarding → dashboard (Scan, Pantry, Recipes, Calendar). We agreed on specific questions to ask users: whether the UI can be improved, if it feels intuitive and cohesive, where they got confused, how many clicks it took for core tasks (add item, generate recipe, check expiration reminders), what extra features they want, and 1–10 ratings for functionality, website design, and user experience. We also set **metrics to measure improvement**: (1) average rating of at least 8/10 in functionality, website design, and user experience, and (2) at least 80% of testers able to complete a core task without asking for clarification.
