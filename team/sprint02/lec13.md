Cross-Team Project Evaluation

In Lecture 13, our team split into two smaller subgroups to participate in a cross-team evaluation activity with the **Rideshare** team.

- One subgroup from our PantryPal team paired with members of the Rideshare team to **evaluate the PantryPal project**, giving feedback on features, UI/UX, and overall usability.
- The other subgroup paired with Rideshare team members to **evaluate the Rideshare project**, providing feedback on their product and seeing a different design and feature set.

This session helped both teams see strengths and weaknesses in two different projects and gather fresh ideas for improvements from an outside perspective.
