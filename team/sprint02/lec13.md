Cross-Team Project Evaluation

In Lecture 13, our team split into two smaller subgroups to participate in a cross-team evaluation activity with the **Rideshare** team.

This session helped both teams see strengths and weaknesses in two different projects and gather fresh ideas for improvements from an outside perspective.
