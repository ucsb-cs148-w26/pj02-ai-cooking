Mahima: I have experience building a web-app with React, Vercel, Gemini’s API, and Firebase. I can help others get familiar with these tools. Over the next few weeks, I will watch and work through tutorials on how to use Next.js and get more familiar with our tech stack. <br>

Daniel: I have experience with Web Page Design with HTML and Javascript, and over the next few weeks I will get familiar with using Next.js/React, firebase, and the holistic view of full stack development.<br>

Andy: I have experience with Google’s AI APIs, React.JS, and JavaScript. I will need to learn about Firebase and Next.Js.<br>

Krisha: I have experience with Google’s Gemini API, React and Vercel. Over the next few weeks, I will learn more about Firebase via online tutorials and I will also learn more about what can be done on Next.js versus React. <br>

Yuxi: I am focusing on getting more familiar with Firebase and data persistence. Over the next few weeks, I will learn how to save and load inventory data using Firebase Firestore. I will also implement the expiration date feature for inventory items, which includes learning how to handle dates in TypeScript and creating date input components in React. I will work through Firebase documentation and pair with Mahima when I have questions about Firebase integration.<br>
